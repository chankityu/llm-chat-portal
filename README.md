# llm-chat-portal
Simple LLM chat portal to transcribe video

# Credits

Large credit to QWEN team https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-vl/ for coming up with such a strong VL model. 

# Sample video file used

Video file used is https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2-VL/space_woaudio.mp4 . 

# Limitation.

Currently, this portal only allows vision to text. Vision extraction to PDF or PPT is not supported.

# Challenges

1. Conflicting Python packages, as well as hardware limitation constraints when we port this code to different environments.
2. Building an MCP model is a challenge in tight deadline and limited time.
3. Will continue building more features in long term.
